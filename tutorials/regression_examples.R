# Adding dummy variables for categorical data

# We can also add categorical variables (variables of type "factor") as predictors
# Dummy variables are indicator variables that take on a value of 
# 1 if a condition is TRUE and 0 if a condition is FALSE 

# Note how a factor that has p levels results in p-1 coefficients added to the regression
# the p-th case (the "base case") is, conceptually, "rolled into" the intercept coefficient
# For a dummy variable this means just one additional coefficient is added to the regression

# We can also create a binary output variable out of either a continuous numeric variable
# or a multileveled factor variable by establishing a cutoff
# For example, we can say that if a person engaged in extramarital sexual intercourse 
# at least once in the past year that they had an affair
# And now we can use logistic regression to examine relationship between predictors and 
# a new response, had_affair

# When we want to mimic an experimental design with a control and treatment group then we may want to
# use a diff-in-diff approach
# What we do is add an interaction term that contains a dummy variable that is TRUE for the treatment
# interacting with another dummy variable that is TRUE for treatment group
